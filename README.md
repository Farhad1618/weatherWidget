# Weather Widget

This is a QML-based Weather Widget application that cycles through three weather conditions: Clear, Frosty, and Hot. The widget features:
	•	Dynamic background gradients and hill colors based on weather states.
	•	A live date and time display at the bottom-right corner.
	•	A sun icon that, when clicked, transitions to the next weather state.

The project adheres to the requirement of using only QML components such as Rectangle, MouseArea, Text, Column, and Timer.

How to Run

	1.	Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
	2.	Open the project in Qt Creator.
	3.	Run the application to see the weather widget in action.
